Lecture on Headers:
-we are going to learn to perform a basic reset using universal selector
-How to set project with font definitions
-How to clip parts of elements using clip-path

on the CSS gradient
  -you can specify the gradient to the right, left, bottom or to right bottom, left top 

on the background-position:
 - we can specify the position to top, bottom, center wch sticks to tht postion no matter the size of screen

 clip-path:
    -creating a curve or edge for image
    -we use polygon function with x and y co-ordinates
    -we can use vh(viewheight) to set image height according to screen size

    check out the css clip-path maker(copy the css cordiantes)


Lecture on Headers 2
    -we r going to add logo
    -we are going to add the header section
    -we used transform attribute to position header text at the center of page
    -we used one header and split it into blocks and each given a class to style it
according to letter spacing, font-weight, size
    -placed the heading in div block to contain the buttons too.


Lecture on Creating Cool CSS Animations
    -creating css animations @keyframes and the animation property
    there are two types of transitions
        -transition property then change property to animate
        -we use @keyframes
    there two ways to animate things on browser either using opacity and transformation
with the transform property (-) meanings moving to left, (+) means moving to right
-translate 0 makes it look the way it does ryt now
-for animation to work, we need to specify the animation name and animation duration

other animation properties
    -aniation-delay: before the animation plays, it will take a given time
    -animation-iteration-count: animation count happens three times before it settles down
    -animation-timing-function: how the parameters we specified will happen over time eg ease-out, ease-out, ease, checkout mozilla css doc
- we can also perform rotations i.e transform: rotate(120deg)

-We can also make animations on hover i.e 
.logo: hover {
    animation: moveInRight;
}
which animates the logo when its hovered

Lecture building complex animated button
-We are going to learn pseudo elements classes and why they are important
-How and why to use the ::after pseudo-element
-How to build a creative hover animation effect using the transition property

So how to we try to make the button appear bigger momentarily when hovered over.

.btn:link,
.btn:visited -- with these links, we want the button after it has been clicked to look the same as before being clicked.

e.g google link before clicked is blue but when clicked its purple which is a default for browsers.
We want ours to remain the same before and after click

-When we finish styling the button, the padding doesnot immediately work because its in a div.
So we need to get it in a inline-block.
Always use inline-block when you want to place padding to elements.

-How do we place the button in the middle of the div?
inline element is treated as though it was text.
so we set the text-box property align to center

Lecture 7:
Building a complex Animated Button 2
-creating the outward zooming effect when we hover over button.
-::after pseudo element looks like the button itself but we put it behind the button and when we hover over btn, pseudo element
goes behind the button.
-z-index:-1 means its behind the main element
