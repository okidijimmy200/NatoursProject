Using Advanced CSS features
LECTURE 1:
Converting CSS to SCSS code
-We will be converting our code to SCSS
-Then we use the BM to nest our selectors

Lecture 2:
Implementing the 7-1 CSS archtiecture with SASS
-Here we create 7 main folders and one main SCSS file to import all files in these folders
-Create the base folder inside Sass  folder and we have a sass folder init called base.scss whih 
has resets and styles for body.
-We shd be able to import this file to the main SCSS file
-Partial files always start with an underscore
-We also include animation files and typography
-Utilities
-This archtiecture is intended to handle large websites 


-We have a folder called abstract thats contains variables, mixins
-We will create our components folder
-Components are held together by the layout of the page
-We need a layout folder for each piece of the entire project so we will have a global footer,
header
-we create page folder for styling individual pages

-We also have themes folder and vendors folder ie animation framework, icon system or bootstrap
-For now we will leave these empty

-btn is a component bse its reusable across the page
-We create a button.scss in the components folder

-We shall treat the header as a layout component bse we may need a header on multiple pages
-Header is better organised as a typography than a layout

Lecture 3:
Review of Basic principes of Responsive Design and Layout types

--1St:
Use of Fluid Grids and Layouts
-So here we use percentages rather than pixels for all layout related length esp width
this is done to enable the content easily adapt to the current view port

--2nd
Flexible and Responsive Images
-Images behave a bit different from text bse they donot scale automatically as we change the view port
-So we need to make images adapt nicely to current view port
-We make images flexible by defining their dimensions in percentages

--3rd
Media Queries
-These enable us to change styles on certain view port width called break points
-This allows developers create different versions of a website for different devices

there are three main ways of laying out a webpage
-float layouts like float left
-Flex box enables you layout multiple elements in a single dimension
-CSS grids is perfect for creating the overall layout of page in fully-fledged 2D grid

Lecture 4
Building a custom Grid with floats
-How to architect and build a simple grid system
-We will learn how the attribute selector works, how the powerful not pseudo-class works
-How calc() function works
-whats the differnece btn simple sass mathematical operations

-A Grid is a design which allows us to build consistent interfaces
-All columns should be in a container called row
- 10px = 1rem
-max width implies that if we have enough available space, then it has the width we specified bt if the viewport is smaller
than 114rem then it fills 100% of available space
-The margin-bottom and max-width can be placed in variable

Not pseudo Selector
--Here we select everything except the last column 

-Since we have column inside of row, we can nest it in the selectors
The total width of column is 100%
to get half the width plus gutter space
-We use the cal function to perform this operation.
-This allows us to make calculations where we can add units

-When performing gutter, it should be on all the righ margiins except the last one
-A clear fix is a mixin that we use in our files
-We will use atrribute selector 
-we will select basing on class wch selects all the elements in which the class attribute starts

Lecture 5:
Building the About Section
-We will learn how to think abt components
-how and why to use utility classes
-how to use the background-clip property
-How to transform multiple property simultaneously
-how to use the outline-offset property together with outline
-how to style elements that are not hovered

**We are going to talk about the think, build architect mindest
-We have heading, paragraphs which is part of typography
-We have button which is

install emmet
-We use 25rem in padding to cover up the triangular space created by the clip path in section for header
-We give it a negative margin to move up

-How to place a gradient on our h2
-How do we make sure the element doesnot occupy 100% of space
-This happens bse its a block element as we do tht
-So we change it to inline block

-We then use the webkit clip-path tool
-This helps us clip the background exactly where the text is
-We make the text transparrent so tht we see only the image

-to perform animation effects

-to place the text in the center, we wrapthe text in a parent element then center it from there
-we shall use utility classes to center the text
-we need to have a utility margin for our project
