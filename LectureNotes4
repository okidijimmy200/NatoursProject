Using Advanced CSS features
LECTURE 1:
Converting CSS to SCSS code
-We will be converting our code to SCSS
-Then we use the BM to nest our selectors

Lecture 2:
Implementing the 7-1 CSS archtiecture with SASS
-Here we create 7 main folders and one SCSS file to import all files in these folders
-Create the base folder inside Sass  folder and we have a sass folder init called base.scss whih 
has resets and styles for body.
-We shd be able to import this file to the main SCSS file
-Partial files always start with an underscore
-We also include animation files and typography
-Utilities
-This archtiecture is intended to handle large websites 


-We have a folder called abstract thats contains variables, mixins
-We will create our components folder
-Components are held together by the layout of the page
-We need a layout folder for each piece of the entire project so we will have a global footer,
header
-we create page folder for styling individual pages

-We also have themes folder and vendors folder ie animation framework, icon system or bootstrap
-For now we will leave these empty

-btn is a component bse its reusable across the page
-We create a button.scss in the components folder

-We shall treat the header as a layout component bse we may need a header on multiple pages
-Header is better organised as a typography than a layout
