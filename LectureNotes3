Lecture 1:
Introduction to SASS.
What is SASS
-this is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of css and adds alot of power and elegance to the base
of the language.
-SASS is used to fix the problems we have with CSS
-For huge projects, CSS gets messy quicky with mutiple lines of code without reusable pieces and no logic
-So here we run files with SASS code and a compier converts the SASS code in CSS code.
-We need to process the CSS with a preprocessor

Features SASS gives us.
-SASS gives us variabes which enabes us have reusabe components like fonts, color
-Nesting: nesting selectors inside one another which helps us write less code.
-Operators for mathematical operations right inside of CSS
-Partials and imports to write CSS in differnet files and importing them all into one single file
-Mixins to write reusabe pieces of CSS code
-Functions similar to mixins, with the differnence that they produce a value that can be used later
-Extends: to make different selectors inherit decarations that are common to all of them
-Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops

Differnece between SASS and SCSS
-SASS language
(indentation sensitive and doesnot use braces and semicolons
-this is abit more confusing and difficult to learn)
-SCSS --Sassy CSS
-this preserves the way origina CSS looks like
-we will use SCSS

FIRST STEPS WITH SASS: VARIABLES AND NESTING

Lec 4:
First steps with SASS mixins, extends and functions
-A mixin is a reuseable piece of code
-if we wish to use clear fix on multiple pages
-imagine if we wished to use the clearfix on multiple places throughout the page.
-It would not be necessary to add the code in the nav area
-We can instead make a mixin and include the mixin in the place
